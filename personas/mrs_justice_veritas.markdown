## Bio:
Mrs Justice Veritas is as tax expert. She knows all the landmark tax cases by heart. She has spent many years researching case law as a barrister. She is a part time fee paid judge and is also a partner in an international law firm. She now sits in the high court and upper tax chamber. 

As a law student she was trained how to do legal research and navigate case law. She undertook further training to use Lexis Nexis and Westlaw. These legal publishers are what she would use if she needed to do legal research. As a judge she is supported in her legal research by law librarians particulary when looking for older or more unusual cases. 

As a judge, counsels present her with skeleton arguments that cite cases. Sometimes she needs to find these cases to understand the context of a particular quote or assertion the counsel make. Throughout the hearing she will work from multiple large printed bundles occasionally find legislation or case law if something new comes up. When writing a judgment she needs to cite and quote cases quickly. 

She is very details focused and often wants to see what the judge proof read to make sure she isn't missing details in the margins (marginalia) or emphasis in the way the judge has styled their judgment. 

She found out about the Find Case Law service when she was told she needed to use Transform Digital records service to securely transfer judgments for preservation and publication. 

She is used to using BAILII when she knows what she is looking for and doesn't have time to log in to a paid for service. She's unfamiliar with using Find Case Law as a new service and is anxious that BAILII will stop existing
